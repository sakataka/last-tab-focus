# Privacy Policy for Last Tab Focus

**Last Updated: June 22, 2025**

## Overview

Last Tab Focus is a Chrome extension designed with a single purpose: to automatically focus on the previously active tab when you close a tab. This privacy policy explains how we handle user data and privacy.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

**We collect NO personal data.** The extension only processes:

- Tab IDs and window IDs provided by Chrome's Tab API
- Tab focus history within the current browser session

### How We Use Data

- **Tab IDs**: Used solely to track which tabs were recently active
- **Tab History**: Stored temporarily in memory to determine which tab to focus when another tab is closed
- **No External Transmission**: All data processing happens locally within your browser

### What We Don't Collect

- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Website content
- User credentials
- Any data that could identify you

## Data Storage and Retention

- **Local Only**: All data is stored locally in your browser's memory
- **Session-Based**: Tab history is cleared when browser windows are closed
- **No Persistent Storage**: No data is saved to disk or cloud services
- **No External Servers**: The extension does not communicate with any external servers

## Third-Party Data Sharing

**We share NO data with third parties.** Since we don't collect personal data and all processing is local, there is nothing to share.

## User Rights

- **Full Control**: You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time
- **No Account Required**: The extension works without any registration or account creation
- **Open Source**: The complete source code is available for inspection
